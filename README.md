 # Telegram_data_analysis
It is a project about analysing data got from telegram chats. You can see how many data you can get from only messages from social media.
I used pandas for analisis because it is comfortable in use and you can see clearly how data looks like.

### Here you can found a lot of examples of chat analitics and their visualization.
### Also here you can find my own dataset of endings in Ukrainian to detect messages' author's gender.

Analisis was made in python.
All plots and statistics are made with pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and plotly.
I have found interesting statistics and would like to continue exploring this data more deeply.

## New statistics I would like to implement:
* Some more gender characteristics:
   * how actitvy of people of diffent h=gender depends on daytime
   * if activity of men and women was changing during two years of studying:
     - if women are more active during time of getting acquainted or not
     - same for men
   * how often do men and women use old-schooled emojis and modern emojis
* General:
   * when do people send more photos - did those days were special?
   * average distribution of smile/emojis among all messages/ my messages
   * from what moment do people start to send voice messages: average time from fiarst active message day to first voice message
   * how do people usually react to me sending tiktoks :)))
   * analyze on which topic we speak more (diagram for parts of day and topics)
