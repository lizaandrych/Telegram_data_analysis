 # Telegram_data_analysis
It is a project about analysing data got from telegram chats. You can see how many data you can get from only messages from social media.
I used pandas for analisis because it is comfortable in use and you can see clearly how data looks like.

### Here you can found a lot of examples of chat analitics and their visualization.

All plots and statistics are made with pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and plotly.
I have found interesting statistics and would like to continue exploring this data more deeply.

## Features I would like to implement:
* Some more gender characteristics:
   * how actitvy of people of diffent h=gender depends on daytime
   * if activity of men and women was changing during two years of studying:
     - if women are more active during time of getting acquainted or not
     - same for men
   * how often do men and women use old-schooled emojis and modern emojis
* General:
   * when do people send more photos - did those days were special?
   * average distribution of smile/emojis among all messages/ my messages
    from what moment do people start to send voice messages: average time from fiarst active message day to first voice message
    how do people usually reacl to me sending tiktoks :)))
